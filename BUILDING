You need the following libraries:

GD2 (http://www.libgd.org/)
libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)

If you're using Mac OS X you can install the libraries with MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).

>> sudo port install libsndfile
>> sudo port install gd2

You can also use Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) on Mac OS X:

>> sudo brew install libsndfile
>> sudo brew install gd

You also need the Cmake build system installed.
(http://www.cmake.org/)


Building:
- Create your build directory and change into it:
>> mkdir build
>> cd build

- Run the Cmake script, it will (hopefully) find your libraries:
>> cmake ..

- Now you can compile waveformgen:
>> make

- And even install the binary:
>> sudo make install
